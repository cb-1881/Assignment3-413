Hi! :)


Assignment 3 gui stuff



This is just barebones to show that we can view every thing thats in 
the database in the gui itself, you will find when you run this program that
there are multiple windows showcasing the apps capabilities:

- a welcome page that just opens everything all at once (watch out)
- login window(hidden behind the other windows needs formatting),

- management windows that have a little table of the existing entries
for each DAO

Theres alot that still needs to be done gui wise but this is what i got so far



INSTRUCTIONS:

run make

TO SETUP DATABASE:
run, make createDatabase

TO POPULATE THE DATABASE:

run, make populateDatabase

THEN RUN THE GUI WITH:

make driver
